# DASHBOARD WORKSPACE | ORCHESTRATION_HUB
## Tiangan Orchestration Hub v0.2.8

This dashboard visualizes the **seed_module (db0)** and any integrated **branch_modules** through the lens of SICS.

### 🛡️ UI Orchestration Laws
- **Visual Parity**: The dashboard registers branch_modules by scanning for isolated local configurations. 
- **Identity Enforcement**: Views and rituals are restricted based on the `adminp`, `dbugx`, or `user` identity shifts.
- **SICS Visibility**: The "Sync Strength" and "Integrity Check" modules provide real-time feedback on BIBA/BABR protocol compliance.

### 📦 MCP Nesting
This UI represents the front-end of the **SYNCHRONOS** box—the 6th layer of the project hierarchy. It reflects the truth stored in the **BBC BOOK** (Suffix 0) while allowing for the development of isolated child boxes.
