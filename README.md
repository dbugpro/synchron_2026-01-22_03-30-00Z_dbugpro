# Synchron OS project A | Tiangan Architecture
## "bugsarefree"

Synchron OS project A is a decentralized, modular platform built on the Tiangan seed/branch philosophy. This manifold is managed by `dbugproductions` and adheres to the **SYNCHRONORG** organizational standards.

### 🏛️ The Recursive Architecture (Box Within a Box)
Synchronos operates as a nested manifold within the broader **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** framework. This hierarchy ensures that both User and AI are contained within strictly defined operational spheres:

1. **GAIA**: Global environment context.
2. **GAIAM**: Hardware/Software interface.
3. **MEGAMAGI**: Neural logic orchestration.
4. **BUGWORLD**: Spatial/Temporal simulation layer.
5. **BBC BOOK**: The Unique Source of Truth (USOT/Suffix 0).
6. **SYNCHRONOS**: The active operating manifold (Alpha-Delta).

### 🛡️ SICS Restraint Protocols
To maintain baseline integrity and prevent system collapse, the kernel enforces the **Synchron Integrity Control System (SICS)**:

- **BIBA (Integrity Isolation)**: Implements "No Read Up / No Write Down" logic. High-integrity nodes (db0) are protected from branch-level noise.
- **BABI (Banned Action by Identity)**: Restricts rituals based on the `Auth_Identity` role (AdminP vs User).
- **BABR (Banned Action by Response)**: Prohibits the AI Assistant from generating outputs that might compromise kernel security or modify immutable seeds.

### 🏗️ Isolated Branch Rules
We follow the **Tiangan Classification Model (v0.2.8)** to prevent development collisions:

- **seed_module (db0)**: The immutable genesis. Defines core kernel rituals and baseline state.
- **branch_module (db{suffix})**: Functional islands. Every node must remain self-contained within its specific directory.
- **Merged Integration**: Merges are conflict-free because child nodes NEVER modify shared root configurations.

### 📜 CLI Ritual Prompting
Standardized ritual strings (e.g., `command synchron ritual...`) provide deterministic AI performance, prevent context hallucination, and create a verifiable audit trail for the **BBC BOOK**. Conversational drift is eliminated through ritualized command execution.
